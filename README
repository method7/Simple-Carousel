Battle of the carousels mootools  v jQuery

says simple on the tin...

A duel with no victors however the mootools carousel (mootools.html) has an issue, 
the clone() process reversed the first part of the infinite carousel, this is 
probably easily fixable but for the time being this “fix” escapes me.
The reason for building the same carousel in both moo and jQuery seemed rather 
important before I just about got here, infinite carousels can be tricky 
especially if you can see more than one item through the port hole. So I 
decided to take a look at how this can be achieved.

Features:
   Endless
   Auto Scroll
   Adjustable porthole 
   Navigation
