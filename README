Battle of the carousels mootools v jQuery

says simple on the tin...

A duel with no victors however the mootools carousel (mootools.html) has an issue, 
the clone() process reversed the first part of the infinite carousel, this is 
probably easily fixable but for the time being this “fix” escapes me.
The reason for building the same carousel in both moo and jQuery seemed rather 
important before I just about got here, infinite carousels can be tricky 
especially if you can see more than one item through the porthole. So I 
decided to take a look at how this can be achieved.

A solution to the mootools issue has been offered on stackOverflow. its not 
ideal but it makes the carousel work properly.
